Spotify Song Request Bot
First of all the only thing required is your own spottily playlist I would suggest making it private and sharing it to the mods so they can add and remove songs while you are in game. You do want to make the playlist collaborative, you make the playlist collaborative by right clicking the playlist in spottily and selecting collaborative playlist.
